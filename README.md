# Capstone-Project-Unicorn-SQL-Spreadsheets-Tableau
The project includes three main parts, each with their own subtasks:

- Data Exploration SQL
- Data Cleaning using Spreadsheets
- Getting Insights using Tableau

**Project Background**

The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The  dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.
Let's suppose that the Unicorn is a family business and is owned by 2 stakeholders who are very invested in their business. They already have a small data analytics team but want to expand it significantly over the next few months. They see you as a candidate for a DA position and provide you with a sample dataset from their sales data.
Your task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost its business growth.

**Project Logistics**

The project is divided into three parts:
- Explore a Unicorn data sample organized into a database with four tables. Answer predefined questions employing SQL.
- Explore a unified dataset (.csv file) in Spreadsheets to visualize the data and find interesting insights.
- Use Tableau to perform exploratory data analysis and pull unique insights from the dataset. Create a dashboard that will present the finding in a dynamic way.
